      `I've been developing full-stack application since I was 10 years old. I didn't know what full-stack meant at that time because the term was not coined back then. I'm so out of content right now that I'm literally crying writing this text since lorem text is so 2023 now.`,
      `After learning HTML and struggling with CSS, I came up with a brilliant idea of using bootstrap and tailwind so that I don't have to style everything by myself and - for obvious reasons - if you knew bootstrap and tailwind, you were cool.`,
      `But now, I'm a legend. I've been coding in React, NextJs, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, Bootstrap, Tailwind, C, C++,Python,Django,FastAPI,Flask programming language and frameworks etc to name a few. Although I barely know the syntax (Psst, Stack overflow!), I consider myself a Ninja developer I'm laughing right now.`,
