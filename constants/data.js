      "I'm an AI/ML plus Full-stack developer with a passion for creating innovative products and web applications that make a significant impact. I am currently working on integrating generative AI models to develop a state-of-the-art.",
    description: [
      `I started creating Full-stackÂ applications when I was seventeen years old. I had no idea what "full-stack" meant back then because the term was still being coined. Once I mastered HTML and CSS, I came to understand the power of Tailwind and Bootstrap. It was so much easier to style with these frameworks, and to be honest, it made me feel pretty cool.`,
      `As of right now, I'm somewhat of a coding legend ðŸ˜…. React, Next.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, Tailwind, C++, Python, FastAPIÂ and many more technologies are among the many that I have worked with. While I still refer to Stack Overflow for syntax (who doesn't?).`,
      `With my full-stack experience, I'm now integrating the amazing fields of ML and generative AI. It's an exciting time to be a developer, and I'm thrilled to be at the intersections of AI and full-stack programming.
